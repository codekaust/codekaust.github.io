I prepare and will stick to a 11 days challenge. Lets see what happens.

## The Challenge
This has been prepared on basis of the solutions discussed in this previous [blog](https://codekaust.github.io/2019/02/27/Life_Paper-Review-and-Strategize.html).

During the period the work at hand is GSOC, regular academics, ShARE Business Case Study, Month-End-Hackathon preparation ordered on basis of priority and urgency. Except these I need to focus on increasing my deep work hours and sleeping timetable with planned morning routine.

You need to log following PERFORMANCE MEASURE table daily. The table contains ideal value and max marks.

|Measure|Value|Marks|
|-|-|-|
|Time Input GSOC|6 hours|30|
|Acads(P1) at library|2 hours|10|
|Total Deep Work(min sitting 2.5hrs) Hours|6 hours|30|
|Meditation-Book Reading-Exercise-Power90(GSOC)|20-20-20-90 minutes|5+5+5+10|
|Wake|Before 7am|5(-5 per half hour)|
||Total|100|

Get extra 5 points on completion of tutorials from Acads(P2).

***Challenge is to log above table each night.***
