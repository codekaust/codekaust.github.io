Hey there! This blog will share my strategies and future plans after not-so-good experience of last two months.

After the previous hectic week and exams, I analyzed thoroughly what I wanted, what is happening and most importantly what steps need to be taken. Never forget regularly reviewing plans is the plan.

The most important reason of this blog was to motivate me for work and remind me my targets. Did it work? Yes, I constantly knew what I had decided to do and was motivated too. Did it perform? NO.

Motivation, attraction and remembrance are not enough to achieve. What needs to be added? PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS and PERFORMANCE MONITORING.

### Status
My highest priority goals were(are):
- GSOC
  - SITUATION **:** *Not yet seriously started. Need to start right now. No tolerable delays. IMPORTANT & URGENT.*
- Internship - Algorithm practice and related preparation for Interviews
  - SITUATION **:** *Not yet seriously started. Need to start ASAP as daily routine. Important not Urgent.*
- Academics
  - Part 1 - Interest(Algorithm D&A, Operating Systems, System Software)
    - SITUATION **:** *Have learned only basics. No in-depth studies done. Again need REGULARITY.*
  - Part 2 - Just for CG(Materials, Software Engineering)
    - SITUATION **:** *Studied and completed in recent exams. But this can't be done in ETE. Need to get regular.*

## Solutions

As the Status speaks I need REGULARITY for each of my goals with big time slots for GSOC. The problem with regularity is, if its a habit then okay otherwise you wont know when the motivation will fade away or some other urgent-not-so-important thing will take away its time.

So, with strategizing these practical-regular goals I need to monitor **PERFORMANCE MEASURES** (least number of regularly calculable, easily quantifiable variables which are directly proportional to progress).

<u>Regular Tasks</u> (Plan the week with these as hard guidelines):
- **GSOC - 6 hours daily**.
  - As this task is very urgent and important so this will always be my highest priority for the day.
- Academics & Algo
  - For now the algorithms particularly focused to internship isn't necessary. So I would add that time to acad's algo.
  - For **acads part2-> Tut-Do-Chart**, no regular practices need to be implemented for them so rather I will maintain a Tut-Do-Chart as discussed below.
  - **Acads part1 -> 2 hours daily (b/w 4 to 8 pm)**.
    - To be done **at Library only**.
- Health and Will-Power maintenance
  - I have experienced and it has been discovered that each of us wakes up with some finite amount of "will" which gets consumed every time we do something which is out-of-comfort (that most of "work" is). If you snooze the first alarm, then waking on the next one would consume a great part of will-stock. So, I really a good morning-ritual.
  - Morning Ritual(2.5 hours):
    - **20-20-20** minutes each to meditation, BG reading, exercise right after I wake up.
    - **Power90** - Dedicate 90 minutes to one of your most important goals which require the highest mental input. For now its GSOC.
    - Perform these at-least *5 days a week in morning, otherwise whenever you wake up.*

Other solutions:
  - **Blogging**
    - In addition to deciding goals, also **set PERFORMANCE MEASURES weekly**.
    - **Log each day** - experience and most importantly the PERFORMANCE MEASURES daily.
  - **Tut-To-Do** - For all subjects maintain a tutorial completion record and post it every weekend.
  - Keep searching for and weekly implementing new strategies each week. Must include a performance measure for each of them.

One other thing I noticed in exams lately is that I really need to work to increase my attention span. I think *Power90* will have good impact in the issue.

Also, here are some tips for day-planning:
- Set goals and evaluate total time for each.
- Find out Deep-Work-TimeBlocks in the day and bound positively perform DW during them.
- Make plans on sheets and keep it with you and just decide plan for next 3-4 hours as per your current state.
- Just remember:
> To draw a circle, you must know the center.

At last I just wanna say that enjoy then work or work then enjoy take the same amount of time and effort of done ideally and in reality working the first way out is too tough and risky. Yes, life is short and this college time won't return too, so enjoy, travel, party and have fun but with knowledge that *life isn't just today*.

I hope all you have a great time ahead. Taking off!
