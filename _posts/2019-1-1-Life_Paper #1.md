This marks the inception of my blog series - **Life_Paper**, as they say - *After a while, we don't regret what we did, but that we didn't.*

# Genesis
Bonjour!!   A Very Happy New Year dear Readers !!!

As this is the first blog let me introduce the series, here in **Life_Paper**, I shall share my weekly learning and experiences mostly about CS related stuff but also books and unprecedented experiences. By the way, that's my *new year resolution* too.

> Knowledge increases by sharing and writing is the best way to absorb it.

The year 2019 is going to be a very crucial and impact-full year for me. With a lot of goals and commitments, I see it as great opportunity to learn to work not just more but *deeper* (in words of Cal Newport), as I firmly believe that [Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)#Components) is one of the most fulfilling feelings I have ever experienced.

My first 6 months, I will focus on :
* *Internship Preparation*
  * Competitive Programming
    * This exploration shall be really helpful with my development work too.
  * Interviews
* *Academics*
  * Operating System
  * Algorithms
  * Other Subjects
* *GSOC*
  * Finding & understanding orgs' product, idea & code-base.
  * Open-source contributions.
* *Other major events*
  * Shrishti - College's tech project exhibition
  * HINT - Hackathon in IIIT Allahabad
  * Eunoia - Slam poetry event in IITR

<br/>In every blog I will share :
* **Strategies** - General rules followed during the week
* **Targets & Accomplishments** -  They may be either time investment target or specific goals.
  * I shall use [Toggl](https://toggl.com/app/timer) for monitoring time.
  * These shall act as *Contents* for every blog.
  * Targets shall usually be same as *Next Week Goals*, or an equivalent updated version of them.
* **Week Story** - This will be a walk through my week with highlighted learnings and resources.
  * Throughout the year, I will try to read a book in 1.5 to 2.5 weeks(as per book size) and try to write blogs on really useful books but will share the essence of each one here.
* **Next Week Goals** - Broad goals for coming week.
