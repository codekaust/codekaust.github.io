# Story
This blog is going to be like a Journal, will track my progress and mistakes for us to learn and be more solution oriented.

#### Log1
Sunday(17Feb) starts with multiple failures. I wasted 3 hours in sleepiness(0430 - 0730) and then again two on internet(0900 - 1100).

Get practical, get solution: (*Applies to Week*)
> ***S1*** - **<u> Exercise 3 Minutes before each New Task</u>**. Will keep you active throughout while not tiring to sleep.

Accomplishments:

|What|Amount|
|---|---|
|Lazy Snoozes|4Hrs|
|Started Work At(time?)|2.00PM(6hrLate)|
|Deep Work Hours|5.5(50%)|
|20-20-20|All three(100%)|
|Number of tasks with S1|2(40%)|
|Total Work Hours|6(40%)|

No, it wasn't what i wanted. I was quite distracted, lets do BETTER TOMORROW, <u>Be Author Tomorrow</u>.

#### Log2
I woke 3.30AM and left bed but my head was boiling.
> ***S2*** - **<u> Wake 7AM. </u>**. There is no point in fighting your body, lets slowly get better.

Accomplishments:

|What|Amount|
|---|---|
|Lazy Snoozes|3Hrs|
|Started Work At(time?)|10.50PM(3.5hrLate)|
|Deep Work Hours|5Hrs(45%)|
|20-20-20|Yes-Yes-Yes|
|Total Work Hours|8|

Not as expected. I had went to library with some target out of which I completed only 50%. Pros-Less Sleepy after food.
REMEMBER TOMORROW : If you feel some tiredness, take a nap don't use your phone or come to room unless you complete the target. Try BETTER TOMORROW.
#### Log3
It was an OKAY day, performance like *Log2*, but things are not going appropriate. I need more concentration and attraction because what I am chasing is not OKAY, its special, so should the chase be.

Remember this tomorrow:
> ***S3*** - **Make general day targets and a time block short commitments, i.e. WHIPLASH**(DW for an hour) **& REST**(5 minute nap(no electronic media))**.**
