# Story
This blog is going to be like a Journal in form of daily logs as that would keep me more transparent and solution oriented.

##### Log1
Sunday(17Feb) starts with multiple failures. I wasted 3 hours in sleepiness(0430 - 0730) and then again two on internet(0900 - 1100).

Get practical, get solution: (*Applies to Week*)
* **S1** - **<u> Exercise 3 Minutes before each New Task</u>**. Will keep you active throughout while not tiring to sleep.

Accomplishments:

|What|Amount & Percent|
|---|---|
|Deep Work Hours|5.5(50%)|
|20-20-20|All three(100%)|
|Number of tasks with S1|2(40%)|
|Total Work Hours|6(40%)|

I was quite distracted throughout the day, didn't have a good start and slept too early in place of a nap. Will try better Day2.
